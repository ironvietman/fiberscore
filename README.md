# Fiberscore

the fiberScore algorithm is template-based detection method used to detect linear objects.
It is mplemeted in MatLab as part of my masters thesis. 
This branch adds some image enhancements before applying the fiberscore algorithm.

## Installation

Requirements:

1. Matlab
2. MatLab Image processing toolbox

## Usage

1. use pathtool to add fiber_tools to MatLab path
2. run fiber_detect.m to process test image

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
