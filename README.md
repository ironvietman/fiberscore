FiberScore (template-based detection method used to detect linear objects in cells)
Implemented in MatLab as part of my masters thesis. See wiki for more information.

## Installation

Requirements:

1. Matlab
2. MatLab Image processing toolbox

## Usage

1. use pathtool to add fiber_tools to MatLab path
2. run fiber_detect.m to process test image

## Credits
Please give credit to me (Robert Pham) when using my functions in your own projects. Let me know if you do. I'm always interested in seeing my code being useful/helpful.
