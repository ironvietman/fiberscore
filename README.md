FiberScore (template-based detection method used to detect linear objects in cells)
Implemeted in MatLab as part of my masters thesis. 
Adds a modification to the FiberScore to measure standard deviation across rods.

## Installation

Requirements:

1. Matlab
2. MatLab Image processing toolbox

## Usage

1. use pathtool to add fiber_tools to MatLab path
2. run fiber_detect.m to process test image
